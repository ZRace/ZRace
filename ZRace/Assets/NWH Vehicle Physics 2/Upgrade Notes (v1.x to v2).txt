Before upgrading to NWH Vehicle Physics 2 please remove any previous versions of NWH Vehicle Physics and Wheel Controller 3D from the project.
NWH Vehicle Physics 2 is significantly different from NWH Vehicle Physics 1 and a manual upgrade of the existing vehicles is required.
Check out Vehicle Setup Wizard script - it speeds things up a lot.

If you encounter any issues along the way please contact us at nwhcoding@gmail.com.
